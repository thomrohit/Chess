# Chess
A Game of Chess built in JAVA 


The game can be run with JAVA and has UI:

Backend(Game logic) is pretty straight forward: OOPS concept.
Frontend ends more work into it: Clearly focused on backed for OOPS concepts then turned into a fully playable game.

<b>NOTE: </b><br>
Only New button works!!! <br>

Still a ton to do: <br>
1.Need to add single player option/ Currently treats it like a 2 player. <br>
2.Checks may still be an issue. <br>
3.Not tried Stalemate. <br>
4.Some moves which cause the King to be in check needs to be handled. <br>
5.Add Unit test cases. <br>


Still developing it :)
