# Chess
A Game of Chess built in JAVA 


The game can be run with JAVA and has UI:

Backend(Game logic) is pretty straight forward: OOPS concept.
Frontend ends more work into it: Clearly focused on backed for OOPS concepts then turned into a fully playable game.

NOTE:
Only New button works !!!

Still a ton to do:
1.Need to add single player option/ Currently treats it like a 2 player.
2.Checks may still be an issue.
3.Not tried Stalemate.
4.Some moves which cause the King to be in check needs to be handled.
5.Add Unit test cases.




Still developing it :)
